<p>Flying Microtonal Banana is the ninth studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. It was released on 24 February 2017. It is unique in how it utilizes an uncommon instrument known as a microtonal guitar, as pictured above. The way the instrument is constructed gives the musician access to a much wider range of sounds to choose from when writing music.</p>

Infest the Rats' Nest is the fifteenth studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. It was released on 16 August 2019. The album was a major experiment with the bands sound, moving away from the crazy, wild sounds of their past albums and opting for a lightning paced, heavy sound. The band also takes an adventurous leap in musical experimentation, choosing to tell a story regarding the fate of humanity in what could be a not-so-distant future, blending science fiction and reality culminating to an intense musical work and possibly one of the best heavy metal projects in the recent past.</p>
